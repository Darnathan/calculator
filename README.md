In this project Im trying to make a working calculator.

The calculator should be able to get user input from buttons.
There should be a working console that shows the user input and when user clicks "="
the console should display the answer
There is a refresh / clear button to clean the console and calculator should be ready for next calculation.

The html part is hard coded by creating a grid.
styling should look something like a windows 98 calculator layout and colors

JS is about adding event listeners and storing user input and sowing it on console.
